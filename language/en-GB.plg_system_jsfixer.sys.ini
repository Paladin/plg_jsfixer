PLG_SYSTEM_JSFIXER="System - JSFixer"

PLG_SYSTEM_JSFIXER_XML_DESCRIPTION="Substitutes a different version of jQuery for the one Joomla ships by default, and patches over some sloppy coding in the core javascript methods that doesn't get along well with jQuery upgrades. <br>The plugin defaults to replacing the default jQuery with jQuery 1.12.4 and Bootstrap 3.3.7 unless different versions are given when 'replace' has been selected. <br>As an added security measure, this plugin also allows a Subresource Integrity hash to be added to the request to assure the correct version is being downloaded from a CDN."
